Samples of a replica of medieval bagpipes, treated as oscillators in a synthesizer.

The seven mappings are:

Wheezy: Samples of the bagpipes tuned to equal temperament with the range extended over a few octaves. One voice per note.

Lonely: Samples of the bagpipes pitch-corrected to perfect equal temperament and spread over a few octaves. Again, one voice per note.

Asthmatic: Eight sampled bagpipe notes used as eight voices to play every note.

Shifty: Eight pitch-corrected bagpipe notes used to play every note. Detune is adjustable, and detunes the voices nearer to the center less than those panned further outside.

Fancy: Eight pitch-corrected bagpipe notes used to play every note. The detune scheme is fixed: lowest notes are not detuned at all, and the detune amount increases gradually with pitch. Inner voices are always detuned less than outer ones.

Baggy: An emulation of bagpipe behavior with natural tuning. There is choice of G or A drones and the natural melody notes found on the instrument, an extra high G, and some trills. The F below the drones is used as a keyswitch to enable chirps.

Doc: Bagpipe behavior with less realism but more flexibility, choice of drones, extened range and equal-tempered tuning. The C below the drones is a keyswitch for chirps.

Except for the last two, all these come in organ, pad and pluck variations. Organ has controls similar to a simple analog synth - AHDSR envelope, pitch vibrato, and resonant low-pass filter. Pad is the same, but the envelope times can be set higher. Pluck is similar to organ but adds a downward sweep to the low-pass filter.

The parameter controls work in Plogue Sforzando and probably won't work in any other SFZ sampler. They use MIDI CC numbers 100 and above rather than the standard ones - this is necessary to place the controls in a logical order on the GUI.
